    "\n",
    "**project_path**: It is used to define some useful subfolders of our flight and it's the folder path that contains all the flight data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**exiftool_path**: The full path of 'exiftool.exe' file saved in dependencies folder. It's used to read the metadata of the micasense captures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**file_path**: Is the full path of some flight capture that contains metadata like GPS, ...; It's used to generate automatically the sensor data needed for georeferencing, ...\n",
    "\n",
    "**flight_folder**: This folder contains all the flight captures in .tif format.\n",
    "\n",
    "**sky_folder**: This folder contains sky captures for calibration.\n",

    "**img_profile**: The profile needed to georefence thumbnails.\n",
    "\n",
    "**bands_profile**: The profile needed to georefence rrs captures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**products_profile**: The profile needed to georefence products captures like chl-a.\n",
    "\n",
    "**img_flip_axis** & **bands_flip_axis**: For georeference it's necessary to flip the data matrix [bands, height, width]. In MicaSense case, flipping the height is sufficient for thumnails and flipping height and width for rrs and products.\n",
    "\n",
    "**steps_in_flight_line**: When processing a flight line, sometimes we want to skip some captures. Setting this variable to 1 means no skip, just process the next capture, 2 means skip 1 capture and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**partitions**: Sometimes we don't want to include all flight lines in our mosaic. This dictionary defines the some slices to process all, even and odd flight lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "**partitions_for_georeference**: The flight lines to georeference\n",
    "\n",
    "**partitions_for_merge**: The flight lines to merge\n",
    "\n",
    "**partitions_for_resample**: The flight lines to resample\n",
    "\n",
    "**merge_methods**: The merge method to use. Available options are 'mean', 'firsr', 'min' and 'max'.\n",
    "\n",
    "**resampling_methods**: Sometime we want to redude the spatial resolution of our mosaic. To achieve that we define this variable with the structure: \n",
    "\n",
    "**resampling_methods**: Sometime we want to redude the spatial resolution of our mosaic. To achieve that we define a Resampling variable contained in the **data_structures.py** file that receives: The resampling method, the x scale, the y scale and a boolean indicating whether to downsample or upsample.\n",
    "\n",
    "**correction**: We normally have to reduce the flight angle by -90 o -270 because of the cameratransform library.\n",
    "\n",
    "**altitude**: Average altitude of the drone during the flight. We usually set this to None. Meaning that we'll use the altitude of each capture for the georeferencing part.\n",
    "\n",
    "**yaw**: Flight angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**pitch**: Average pitch of the drone during the flight. We usually set this to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "**roll**: Average roll of the drone during the flight. We usually set this to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "**band_names**: If we set this variable using sensor.band_names or whatever we want, the mosaic will be splitted if the number of bands is the mosaic has the same length as band_names. In other case, the mosaic will not be splitted. The variable have the structure List[str]. Example: ['blue', 'red', ...]"
